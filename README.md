# Appolice Server

This is the server application to appolice server. It holds the admin area,
the website and the RESTAPIs for the application.

The stack we are using are:
  - IcedCoffeeScript (CoffeeScript with Async steroids).
  - Express as the backend.
  - MongoDB as our database with Mongoose.
  - RiotJS as the front-end.
  - Testing with jsVerify and Mocha.

Installation
  1. MongoDB server: `sudo apt-get install mongodb`
  2. Appolice libraries: `sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev`

It is possible that some more requirements are missing. So install
until everything is properly running.
